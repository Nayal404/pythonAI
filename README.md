# pythonAI Developed by Nayal/Om Sunar
# To install the AI on your device
## Type these commands given below

### cd pythonAI
### ls
### python AI.py
## And you're done enjoy with my python AI
## Yes I know that it runs on typed commands not voice commands but soon I'll try to make it like Tony Stark's Jarvis AI☺😁
