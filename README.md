# pythonAI Developed by Nayal/Om Sunar
# To install the AI on your device
## Type these commands given below
## First you need to install pyttsx3 & wikipedia module in your device by using the command
### $pip install pyttsx3 && wikipedia (If this doesn't worked you can either install them one by one like):-
### $pip install pyttsx3 
### $pip install wikipedia
### $git clone https://Nayal404/pythonAI.git
### $cd pythonAI
### $ls
### $python AI.py
## And you're done enjoy with my python AI
## Yes I know that it runs on typed commands not voice commands but soon I'll try to make it like Tony Stark's Jarvis AI☺😁
# Thanks for visiting my Repo :) Have a wonderful Day :)😁😁
